## About this site

The goal is to accumulate the content that I currently have spread out on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUYqJUnI_P0XYk6_FRyvb2w), [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/mgei), [Github](https://github.com/mgei), my [company website](https://www.econovo.ch), and on my own system (and is non-confidential). The website is to serve as a reference for myself primary. Maybe it also helps others.

## About me

Hello, my name is Martin Geissmann. I studied economics in Basel and Zurich before starting to work in healthcare management. Currently, I run a company [Econovo](https://www.econovo.ch) which offers mainly data consulting services to medical service providers, especially also in radiology. 

In my time off I enjoy to train my horse, travel, and I have great interest in experimenting with technology.
