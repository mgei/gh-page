## This site

The goal is to consolidate the content that I have published on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUYqJUnI_P0XYk6_FRyvb2w), [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/mgei), [Github](https://github.com/mgei), my [company's website](https://www.econovo.ch), as well as non-confidential material from on my own work. The main purpose is to have an archive ready as a personal reference, i.e. myself looking things up. Maybe it also helps others.

## Me

My name is Martin Geissmann. I studied economics in Basel and Zurich before my professional track led me to healthcare management. Currently, I run a company [Econovo](https://www.econovo.ch) which offers data consulting services mainly to medical service providers, especially also in radiology. 

In my time off I enjoy training my horse, I travel, and I have great interest in experimenting with technology.
