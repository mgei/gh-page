<p>How to geocode locations or addresses in R with library(ggmap) in 2018/2019. Previously you could just use geocode(“New York”) to get the coordinates, but Google now required a Google Cloud Platform API key. Get the latest ggmap version from Github, and a free 12 month trial to GCP. This is how you geocode now.</p>
<p>We will create a leaflet map with library(leaflet) in R. This creates nice interactive maps that can also be inserted into a Shiny application. I plan to create more videos on these steps.</p>
